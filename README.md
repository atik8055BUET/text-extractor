# Text Extractor for Kali Linux GNOME

A lightweight utility that lets you select a screen area, perform OCR using **Tesseract**, and automatically copy the extracted text to your clipboard. This repository also demonstrates how to package the script as a `.deb` for easy distribution, add a desktop icon/launcher, and set a GNOME keyboard shortcut (e.g., **Super+T**).

## Features

- **Area Selection**: Select any portion of the screen to capture.
- **OCR Extraction**: Automatically runs [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
- **Clipboard Copy**: Places the recognized text into your clipboard for easy pasting.
- **Desktop Notification**: Informs you once extraction is complete.
- **Installable**: Provides a guide to package as a `.deb` and integrate into your system menu with an icon.
- **Optional Keyboard Shortcut**: Can be configured (via GNOMEâ€™s keyboard settings or a dconf override) to launch with **Win+T** or any other key combo.
